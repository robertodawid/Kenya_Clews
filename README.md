# Kenya_Clews

The Kenya-CLEWs model is part of the research workstreams (WS) under the [Climate Compatible Growth (CCG) program](https://climatecompatiblegrowth.com). WS4 Sector Interactions aims to co-create approaches to assessing broader sector interactions with energy and transport systems and climate-resilient system choices and their linkages.
The Kenya-CLEWS model contributes to one of the activities planned under WS4. This activity involves the Development of the existing Climate,  Land,  Energy  &  Water  Strategies  (CLEWs)  model framework. For the inception stage assessments of water-land-energy linkages,  the well-established CLEWS platform will be used to explore these sector interdependencies. There will also be a research track that advances the Development of this modeling framework based on the continued implementation of the framework.

*Figure 1. Reference Clews*

Figure 1 shows the reference energy system for the Kenya-CLEWS model. The reference system represents the energy supply chains to meet energy demand in the cooking sector. It also shows the disaggregation of specific technologies used for cooking. In addition, it shows the interlinkages between land, energy, and water systems for different crops and other products such as wood, charcoal, and wood products.
For each sector,  one or more demands for energy are defined exogenously. Several competing energy supply options and related conversion processes meet these demands through time. It is possible to modify the techno-economic characteristics of each energy supply option and conversion process. The technological options are chosen based on a cost-minimization criterion.  

A Zenodo repository contains the techno-economic parameters used in the Kenya-CLEWS model, and these can be accessed in [Kenya_Clews_data](https://zenodo.org/record/7303625#.Y2oqkHbMKHs). These parameters include cost and efficiencies for cooking technologies and charcoal production. Other historical data has been used to derive cultivated areas and the production of specific crops. This model version includes the cooking sector and five crops. Crops included in this model are wheat, maize, barley, tea, and coffee. 

The folder  [model](https://github.com/robertodawid/Kenya_Clews/tree/main/model), contains the instructions needed to read, run and print the results for the Kenya_Clews model.
